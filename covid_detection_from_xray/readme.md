# covid_detection_from_xray
This repository contains base work for covid detection through x-ray. This project was a part of a workshop organised by DSC Surat.

The task is to detect whether pneunomonia or covid-19 is present from x-ray images or patient is completely normal.
### Important datasets link
<ul>
  <li> https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset </li>

</ul>

From the first link I collected x-ray images containing covid-19, the information about labels are extracted from metadata.csv and images are in images folder.<br>
From the second link I collected x-ray images containing pneunomonia and normal x-ray images.
